Hello my name if Richard Twiggs. This is the homework 1 presentation for SIE-508

I separated the inventory tool into six .py files; config, main, model, view, controller and inventory.csv which is referred to in the code as datafile. I chose to use a .csv file because rows and columns easily relate to sql patterns.

So that I only have to hardcode the datafile name and its column names a single time, I store those global variables in config.py and import that into each program file that needs it.

The datafile is called inventory.csv. If it does not exist the script will create it. So lets just delete it and demo that.

You can see that inventory.csv exists and has bulk loaded five rows.

Lets demo the rest:

Insert a single item for bacon. When you display all rows you see bacon added to the end.

Let's try to insert something that already exists. Bread already exists so let's try to insert it with a different price. You see the old record for bread exists but not a duplicate with the new price.

Let's read a single item. This will run through the search function and if found, outputs the requested data. Searching for bacon we get bacon data. But searching for cookies we get a not found message.

Looks like the price of bacon went up. Let's modify our inventory system. Before the price goes up, lets also buy some more and increase that quantity. Now a search for bacon shows the updated record. From 4.46 each qty 10 to 4.48 each qty 30.

Try to update something that does not exist and you get the not found message.

Let's delete bread and show all records. Bread is no longer here.
Again, try to delete something that does not exist and receive the error message.

Thanks for watching.
